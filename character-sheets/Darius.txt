DF2: Darius shoots a capsule out of his sleeve, which bounces upon the ground in an arc. A hit enemy is staggered slightly. A meter burned capsule explodes upon impact, dealing extra damage and knocking up the opponent.
DB4: Darius falls back into a portal, appearing behind the opponent. meter burning this gives Darius immunity to damage while this ability takes place and causes him to attempt to grab the enemy upon leaving the portal. On grabbing the opponent, he throws them forward into a portal which causes them to appear behind him. He then grabs behind him and throws the opponent down in front of himself, knocking them up.

If meter burned, a grounded opponent will instead fly through a portal and appear directly behind you, and an airborne opponent will be smashed into the ground repeatedly instead, then slid a medium distance away.
